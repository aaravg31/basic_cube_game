# COSC 519 (J) ‚Äì Lab 1  
**Project Title:** Basic Cube Game ‚Äì Interactive Unity Game  

---

## üéÆ Project Description  
This project is a Unity-based interactive game developed for **COSC 519 (J) Lab 1**.  
The player controls a cube in a darkened environment, collecting coins, leaving behind glowing orb trails, and experiencing visual and audio feedback that enhances immersion.  

The goal was to implement **at least 5 interactive elements** in the scene while building familiarity with Unity, C#, and game mechanics.

## ‚ú® Interactive Elements  

1. **Player Movement (Keyboard Input)**  
   - The cube can be moved using **WASD** or **arrow keys**.  
   - This provides direct control and forms the foundation of the game interaction.  

2. **Coin Collection (Trigger Interaction + Physics)**  
   - Coins are spawned randomly on the ground.  
   - When the player collides with a coin, it is destroyed, the score increases, and a **coin collection sound** plays.  

3. **Score UI (UI Interaction)**  
   - A dynamic UI element displays the player‚Äôs **current score**.  
   - A **high score** system is also implemented, persisting across play sessions.  

4. **Glowing Orb Trail (Visual + Time-based Animation)**  
   - As the cube moves, it leaves behind glowing spheres.  
   - The spheres gradually change color from **cyan ‚Üí blue ‚Üí purple**, fade out over ~5 seconds, and disappear.  
   - This creates a ‚Äúshifting wave‚Äù trail effect.  

5. **Background Music (Audio Interaction)**  
   - A looping background track plays during gameplay, setting the atmosphere.  
   - Audio settings are configured for looping and balanced with sound effects.

## üîπ Additional Features  
- **Laser Borders:** Imported laser prefabs are positioned along the floor edges to visually indicate danger zones.  
- **Game Over Mechanic:** If the player falls below the ground plane, the game ends and restarts.  
- **Dark Aesthetic:** Background, ground, and materials are styled with a moody color scheme to enhance immersion.

## üöÄ How to Play  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the project in Unity (URP recommended).  
3. Press **Play** in the editor.  
4. Move with **WASD/Arrow Keys**, collect coins, and enjoy the interactive elements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Player Movement (`playerHandler.cs` + `FollowPlayer.cs`)
- Handles cube movement with **WASD/arrow keys** using Unity‚Äôs physics system (`Rigidbody.MovePosition`).  
- Checks player position: if the cube falls below `y = -0.3`, it calls `EndGame()`.
- The **FollowPlayer** script makes the camera smoothly follow the player with an offset, always keeping them in view.

### Coin Collection (`CoinScript.cs` + `CoinSpawner.cs`)
- **CoinSpawner** spawns coins randomly on the ground at the start.  
- **CoinScript** listens for `OnTriggerEnter` with the player:
  - Increases score (`IncreasePoints()`).
  - Plays a coin pickup sound.
  - Destroys the collected coin and spawns a replacement.  

### Score System (`playerHandler.cs`)
- Maintains current score in `points`.  
- Updates **UI Text** with each coin collected.  
- Uses **PlayerPrefs** to save a persistent **High Score**, displayed at game start.

### Orb Trail Effect (`OrbColourCycle.cs` + `TrailScript.cs`)
- As the player moves, glowing orbs spawn behind them.  
- Each orb:
  - Shifts color **cyan ‚Üí blue ‚Üí purple** over 5 seconds.
  - Fades and disappears after 5 seconds.
- Creates a dynamic ‚Äúwave-like‚Äù trail following the cube.

### Audio
- **Background music** plays in a loop via `AudioSource` on a `BG_Music` GameObject.  
- **Sound effect** plays each time a coin is collected (`AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint`).

### Laser Borders
- Laser prefabs imported from an asset pack are placed at floor edges.  
- Visually indicate danger zones; can optionally trigger game over if the player touches them.
